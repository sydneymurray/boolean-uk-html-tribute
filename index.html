    <h2>
      Steven Paul Jobs born 24th February 1955, died 5th October 2011
    </h2>
    <h3>
      He was an...<br />
      <ul>
        <li>American business magnate</li>
        <li>Industrial designer</li>
        <li>Media proprietor</li>
        <li>Co Founder & CEO of Apple</li>
        <li>Founder & CEO of NeXT</li>
      </ul>
      He brought windows, icons and a mouse to the office computer desktop,
      introducing a new easier way to interact with your computer

      The above is a picture of the computer that Tim Berners Lee used to create
      the World-Wide-Web.<br />
      It is the first Web-Server!!<br />
      So without Steve Jobs, the internet would be a completely different
      experience, probably own by the big corporations like IBM, Microsoft etc
      that would charge big money for access.<br /><br />
      Steve changed the world! <br />
      Twice!
